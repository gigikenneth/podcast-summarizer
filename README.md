## [Project for Week 1 of Uplimit's Building AI Products with Open AI](https://uplimit.com/course/building-ai-products-with-openai)

Part 1: Use a large language model from OpenAI to build the information extraction functionality, paired with a speech-to-text model for transcribing the podcast.

Part 2: Use a simple cloud deployment provider to easily convert the information extraction function to run on demand â€“ This would be the app backend.

Part 3: Use ChatGPT from OpenAI as your coding assistant to create and deploy a front-end that allows users to experience the end-to-end functionality.
